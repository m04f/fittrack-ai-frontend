## Can I connect a custom domain to my GitHub Pages deployment?

Yes! You can easily connect a custom domain to your GitHub Pages deployment. Go to your repository settings, then to the Pages section, and you will see a section where you can add your custom domain.

Before you add it to the project settings, you need to configure your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages' servers.
